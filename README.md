# Convenient-Programs
Programs I wrote to help me with other classes or just because I wanted to. Created after Heaps_Sorts_Trees (which otherwise would be here).

Base Converter - Converts values given in decimal base to hex, octal, or binary, and vice-versa
  - Might add any base to any other base as an option in the future.
  - Input error checking will be added later.
